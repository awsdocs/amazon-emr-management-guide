 The AWS SDKs provide functions that wrap the API and take care of many of the connection details, such as calculating signatures, handling request retries, and error handling\. The SDKs also contain sample code, tutorials, and other resources to help you get started writing applications that call AWS\. Calling the wrapper functions in an SDK can greatly simplify the process of writing an AWS application\. 

 For more information about how to download and use the AWS SDKs, see SDKs under [Tools for Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/)\.
