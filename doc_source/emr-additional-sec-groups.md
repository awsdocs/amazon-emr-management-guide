# Working With Additional Security Groups<a name="emr-additional-sec-groups"></a>

Whether you use the default managed security groups or specify custom managed security groups, you can use additional security groups\. Additional security groups give you the flexibility to tailor access between different clusters and from external clients, resources, and applications\.

Consider the following scenario as an example\. You have multiple clusters that you need to communicate with each other, but you want to allow inbound SSH access to the master instance for only a particular subset of clusters\. To do this, you can use the same set of managed security groups for the clusters\. You then create additional security groups that allow inbound SSH access from trusted clients, and specify the additional security groups for the master instance to each cluster in the subset\.

You can apply up to four additional security groups for the master instance, four for core and task instances, and four for service access \(in private subnets\)\. If necessary, you can specify the same additional security group for master instances, core and task instances, and service access\. The maximum number of security groups and rules in your account is subject to account limits\.
