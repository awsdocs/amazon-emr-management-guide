# Considerations for Running Multiple Steps in Parallel<a name="emr-concurrent-steps"></a>
+ Steps running in parallel may complete in any order, but pending steps in queue transition to running state in the order they were submitted\.
+ When you select a step concurrency level for your cluster, you must consider whether or not the master node instance type meets the memory requirements of user workloads\. The main step executer process runs on the master node for each step\. Running multiple steps in parallel requires more memory and CPU utilization from the master node than running one step at a time\. 
+ To achieve complex scheduling and resource management of concurrent steps, you can use YARN scheduling features such as `FairScheduler` or `CapacityScheduler`\. For example, you can use `FairScheduler` with a `queueMaxAppsDefault` set to prevent more than a certain number of jobs from running at a time\. 
+ The step concurrency level is subject to the configurations of resource managers\. For example, if YARN is configured with only a parallelism of `5`, then you can only have five YARN applications running in parallel even if the `StepConcurrencyLevel` is set to `10`\. For more information about configuring resource managers, see [Configuring Applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-configure-apps.html) in the *Amazon EMR Release Guide*\.
+ You cannot add a step with an `ActionOnFailure` other than CONTINUE while the step concurrency level of the cluster is greater than 1\.
+ If the step concurrency level of a cluster is greater than one, step `ActionOnFailure` feature will not activate\.
+ If a cluster has setp concurrency level `1` but has multiple running steps, `TERMINATE_CLUSTER ActionOnFailure` may activate, but `CANCEL_AND_WAIT ActionOnFailure` will not\. This edge case arises when the cluster step concurrency level was greater than one, but lowered while multiple steps were running\.
+ You can use EMR automatic scaling to scale up and down based on the YARN resources to prevent resource contention\. For more information, see [Using Automatic Scaling in Amazon EMR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-automatic-scaling.html) in the *Amazon EMR Management Guide*\.
+ When you decrease the step concurrent level, EMR allows any running steps to complete before reducing the number of steps\. If the resources are exhausted because the cluster is running too many concurrent steps, we recommend manually canceling any running steps to free up resources\.
